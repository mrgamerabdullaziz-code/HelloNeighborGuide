<h2>Hello Neighbor Act 1</h2>
<p>To finish Hello Neighbor Act 1</p>
<p>There are 2 ways</p>
  The wrench and The Lever
1.The wrench:First you'll need to take at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see alot of paintings in the room(you might also see a lever on top of the ladder do not press it).Take the biggest one.A hole will later be revealed.Go through the hole(jumping will help).Then take your left, you should see 3 keys, take the left, red one, which is the car key.Then go back through the hole again, go out through the window, then jump outside towards the neighbors car. Open the cars front.There you should see a magnet, take the magnet to the back of the house, there you should also see tons of boxes, take at least 2 or 3. Then find the small hole next to the locked ladder. There you should place your boxes and jump on them(if you are too much above the hole you can take a box). Look for the shelf in which you can see many items. You'll only need the lockpick. Take it by pushing and holding the magnet.When you have the lockpick, throw away anything else then look for an open window in the backyard and keep on going left until you find the locked door.
