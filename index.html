<h2>Hello Neighbor Act 1</h2>
<p>To finish Hello Neighbor Act 1,
There are 2 ways to get the red key.</p>
  <p>The wrench and The Lever ways</p>

<p>1.The wrench way:</p>

<p>First you'll need to take at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see alot of paintings in the room(you might also see a lever on top of the ladder do not press it).Take the biggest one.A hole will later be revealed.Go through the hole(jumping will help).Then take your left, you should see 3 keys, take the left, red one, which is the car key.Then go back through the hole again, go out through the window, then jump outside towards the neighbors car. Open the cars front.There you should see a magnet, take the magnet to the back of the house, there you should also see tons of boxes, take at least 2 or 3. Then find the small hole next to the locked ladder. There you should place your boxes and jump on them(if you are too much above the hole you can take a box). Look for the shelf in which you can see many items. You'll only need the lockpick. Take it by pushing and holding the magnet.When you have the lockpick, throw away anything else then look for an open window in the backyard and keep on going left until you find the locked door.Then you should use the lockpick to open the door and take the goldet wrench, then you should get back using the same way you got in(and you should do this as fast as you can). You should later use the wrench on the locked ladder and climb it.Once you're done climbing, you should see a plank, walk on it and jump on the broken roof roof Infront of you.Then you should see the red key.</p><br/><br/>

<p>2.The lever way: </p>

First you'll need to take  the ball and at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see a wooden board with a lever to your right,take the biggest painting and go through the hole.Once you're there keep going forwards till you see a lever,press it then go back to the plank.There you should also see a fan with a small switch in it.Press the switch, place your ball and go back as fast as you can to the left side of the house, Infront of the car(and make sure a box or trash can is with you.)There you should see a platform in which there's a window above it,sprint towards the window and wait till the platform rises.Once it does break the window then get inside the room.Then you should see the red key.</p>
<p>Once you see the key in either way go back outside the house, go inside and go right there you should see the red door lock.Open the lock then get in the basement.</p>

<p>The basement</p>

<p>Once you're in the basement, walk down the stairs, and open the washer machine.Then a secret passage should be revealed.Walk through it and you should see a sleeping room.There you'll see four windows, go towards the right ones and take one.Sprint your way towards every caged door you see while also ignoring every wooden door(if you're late the neighbor will come for you)and then you should see a mannequin, take it and keep sprinting.Once you see two side hallways left and right take the right one and keep running.There you should see another caged door and another mannequin and a lever.Unlock the door using the lever and if you didn't take the first mannequin, feel free to take this one, but if you did ignore this one.Once you enter the room, you can open the chair locked door this time by taking the chair(and keeping it with you) and opening the door.Then you should see a brick wall, run towards it breaking it.Then you should see a humongous cage to your right, this is where you get to use your items.Place the painting Infront of the cage(facing it's opposite side),throw your mannequin at the top of the painting in a very strong way,make sure it doesn't fall on the ground and that its top is touching the highest edge of the cage, then add your chair(if necessary)to jump on the painting and sprint towards the other side of the cage.There you should see a machine with a red button, make sure to press it to make it green, and use the items on your left to climb the cage.Then get back to the chair locked door room the same way you got in, then you should see the exit door with a cage locking it with a lever next to it, press the lever to release the cage(if it doesn't work then the button is still red), and freely open the door.Once you open the door, you should see a hallway, in the same time a cutscene will be shown showing the neighbor get in (in a very bad mood). Then the cutscene will end, once it does, you should run the fastest you can through the hallway till you encounter the locked door.Once you do,wait till the neighbor gets you which will activate act two.</p>
<h2 id="2">Hello Neighbor 2</h2>
<p>You're first gonna start at the basement in which you'll see a door, peak through it and wait till you see a wooden statue.Once you see it, open the door and look to your left where you can see a vent, open and complete your through it till you see a ladder to your right climb it, open the trapdoor above you, and you should see a the backyard of the house.And you'll notice that the yard is boarded by tall fences.</p>

<p>To escape the yard, there are 3 ways:The crowbar way,the trampoline way, and the red key way.</p>

<p>1.The red key way:</p>

 <p> To aquire the red key you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch. To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of thew switches wasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel. After taking it go back to the platform and back to the pipe, there you should see another pipe, try walking on it till you see a metal rod on it.Place the wheel on the rod, turn the wheel and take it(do the same with the other pipes).Go to the nearest window and break it using the wheel(or any other item) and take it, then enter the the room and open the door.There you should see a machine with another rod, after placing the wheel turn the lever next to it and leave the room.The other pipe is found by climbing a ladder next to and jumping on the roof next it where you should see the pipe(and make sure to take the wheel with you).Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see a hoe, take it and complete your path.Next, you should see a ladder, go down the ladder till you see a roof and another floor, go to the roof and to the ladder.Next, clim down the ladder till you see sand next to the trapdoor, use the hoe on the sand and keep digging till you see a coffin, take the coffin(dont open it)and the dollhouse key should be revealed.Go back to the pool and climb down the ladder to the other floor and there, you should see the dollhouse.Open it, and you should see 2 doors in it.One has a WC next it and another with a machine.Open the one with the machine and go right till you see a door, open it and you should see a huge room with a ladder, stairs, and a door.Go to the door, and you should see the machine(the same one from the dollhouse)with a lever in it.Press the lever and leave the room, then climb the ladder.There you should see a huge hole with a another sink-lookin pipe and another door on the other side.Place the wheel on the pipe and turn.After turning it you should see rising ice.Wait till the ice stops rising and ,then take the opportunity to open the door which should allow you to see another small empty room.Look and right and there you should see the red key.Take it and go back to the huge room, then go down the stairs, ignore the machine infront of you(its for the trampoline waw)and turn left.There you should see a locked door with its key next it.Use the key on the door and you should see the main house door.Go to the door and open it and you shpuld see the red key lock on the fence infront of you.Use the key the on the fence as quickly as possible.Open the fence and run away to activate act 3.</p>

<p>2.The crowbar way:</p

</p>To aquire the crowbar you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch. To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of the switches wasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel.Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see a hoe, take it and complete your path.Next, you should see a ladder, go down the ladder till you see a roof and another floor, go to the roof and to the ladder.Next, clim down the ladder till you see sand next to the trapdoor, use the hoe on the sand and keep digging till you see a coffin, take the coffin(dont open it)and the dollhouse key should be revealed.Go back to the pool and climb down the ladder to the other floor and there, you should see the dollhouse.Open it, and you should see 2 doors in it.One has a WC next it and another with a machine.Open the one with the WC next to it and go back up the ladder onto the roof.Next go to the house and to the kitchen.You should see two doors in the kitchen open the right one and you should see the toilet with a Lego man on the WC.Take it and go back to the dollhouse, place the Lego man on the WC in the dollhouse and go back again to the toilet.There you should see another gigantic Lego man with a gigantic crowbar.the crowbar can be either used on the windows on the roof or on a wood-boarded hole in the fence.Removing these wood planks is also another way to activate act 3.</p>



<p>To open the trampoline gate you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch.To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of the switcheswasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel.Next you should place the wheel on several pipes, turn it and take it back:first one is next to the tallest pipe.Second one is on top of the roof.Third one is in the room that's next to the tallest pipe that can only be found in the nearest window to the tallest pipe, which is actually a machine not pipe(once you've placed the wheel on the last one you must make sure you've pressed the switch on the machine).Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see another room where there are boxes and tables and a ladder, take at least 2 boxes and 1 table and go to the ladder.And walk down the ladder till you see another floor below.Once you land on the floor, you should ignore the locked dollhouse you might see and turn right to see a door, open it and a huge room will be revealed with a ladder, stairs, and door Ignore the door and ladder and walk down the stairs which should allow you to see a machine with another rod.Place your wheel on the machine, turn it(if necessary), press the lever, and turn left to see a locked door with it's key next to it, use the key on the door to open, and you should see another door(it could be open or close)go to the door and open it.Then you should see to your right that the trampoline cage is released, but the electric fence is still there.This is where your your boxes and table come in handy.You should go to the trampoline fence(it's better to keep yourself behind the fence so the neighbor can't see you)place your table then the 2 boxes(this might take alot of tries), jump on them, and this should allow you to jump on the fence and to the trampoline.Once your on the trampoline you're gonna jump very high, take this opportunity to escape the house and activate act 3 as the last way to do it.
