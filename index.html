<h2>Hello Neighbor Act 1</h2>
<p>To finish Hello Neighbor Act 1</p>
<p>There are 2 ways</p>
  <p>The wrench and The Lever ways</p>

<p>1.The wrench way:</p>

<p>First you'll need to take at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see alot of paintings in the room(you might also see a lever on top of the ladder do not press it).Take the biggest one.A hole will later be revealed.Go through the hole(jumping will help).Then take your left, you should see 3 keys, take the left, red one, which is the car key.Then go back through the hole again, go out through the window, then jump outside towards the neighbors car. Open the cars front.There you should see a magnet, take the magnet to the back of the house, there you should also see tons of boxes, take at least 2 or 3. Then find the small hole next to the locked ladder. There you should place your boxes and jump on them(if you are too much above the hole you can take a box). Look for the shelf in which you can see many items. You'll only need the lockpick. Take it by pushing and holding the magnet.When you have the lockpick, throw away anything else then look for an open window in the backyard and keep on going left until you find the locked door.Then you should use the lockpick to open the door and take the goldet wrench, then you should get back using the same way you got in(and you should do this as fast as you can). You should later use the wrench on the locked ladder and climb it.Once you're done climbing, you should see a plank, walk on it and jump on the broken roof roof Infront of you.Then you should see the red key.</p><br/><br/>
<p>2.The lever wayFirst you'll need to take  the ball and at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see a wooden board with a lever to your right,take the biggest painting and go through the hole.Once you're there keep going forwards till you see a lever,press it then go back to the plank.There you should also see a fan with a small switch in it.Press the switch, place your ball and go back as fast as you can to the left side of the house, Infront of the car(and make sure a box or trash can is with you.)There you should see a platform in which there's a window above it,sprint towards the window and wait till the platform rises.Once it does break the window then get inside the room.Then you should see the red key.</p>
<p>Once you see the key in either way go back outside the house, go inside and go right there you should see the red door lock.Open the lock then get in the basement.</p>

<p>The basement</p>
<p>Once your in the basement, walk down the stairs </p>
