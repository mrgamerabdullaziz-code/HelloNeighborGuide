<h2>Hello Neighbor Act 1</h2>
<p>To finish Hello Neighbor Act 1,
There are 2 ways to get the red key.</p>
  <p>The wrench and The Lever ways</p>

<p>1.The wrench way:</p>

<p>First you'll need to take at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see alot of paintings in the room(you might also see a lever on top of the ladder do not press it).Take the biggest one.A hole will later be revealed.Go through the hole(jumping will help).Then take your left, you should see 3 keys, take the left, red one, which is the car key.Then go back through the hole again, go out through the window, then jump outside towards the neighbors car. Open the cars front.There you should see a magnet, take the magnet to the back of the house, there you should also see tons of boxes, take at least 2 or 3. Then find the small hole next to the locked ladder. There you should place your boxes and jump on them(if you are too much above the hole you can take a box). Look for the shelf in which you can see many items. You'll only need the lockpick. Take it by pushing and holding the magnet.When you have the lockpick, throw away anything else then look for an open window in the backyard and keep on going left until you find the locked door.Then you should use the lockpick to open the door and take the goldet wrench, then you should get back using the same way you got in(and you should do this as fast as you can). You should later use the wrench on the locked ladder and climb it.Once you're done climbing, you should see a plank, walk on it and jump on the broken roof roof Infront of you.Then you should see the red key.</p><br/><br/>

<p>2.The lever way:</p>

First you'll need to take  the ball and at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see a wooden board with a lever to your right,take the biggest painting and go through the hole.Once you're there keep going forwards till you see a lever,press it then go back to the plank.There you should also see a fan with a small switch in it.Press the switch, place your ball and go back as fast as you can to the left side of the house, Infront of the car(and make sure a box or trash can is with you.)There you should see a platform in which there's a window above it,sprint towards the window and wait till the platform rises.Once it does break the window then get inside the room.Then you should see the red key.</p>
<p>Once you see the key in either way go back outside the house, go inside and go right there you should see the red door lock.Open the lock then get in the basement.</p>

<p>The basement:</p>

<p>Once you're in the basement, walk down the stairs, and open the washer machine.Then a secret passage should be revealed.Walk through it and you should see a sleeping room.There you'll see four windows, go towards the right ones and take one.Sprint your way towards every caged door you see while also ignoring every wooden door(if you're late the neighbor will come for you)and then you should see a mannequin, take it and keep sprinting.Once you see two side hallways left and right take the right one and keep running.There you should see another caged door and another mannequin and a lever.Unlock the door using the lever and if you didn't take the first mannequin, feel free to take this one, but if you did ignore this one.Once you enter the room, you can open the chair locked door this time by taking the chair(and keeping it with you) and opening the door.Then you should see a brick wall, run towards it breaking it.Then you should see a humongous cage to your right, this is where you get to use your items.Place the painting Infront of the cage(facing it's opposite side),throw your mannequin at the top of the painting in a very strong way,make sure it doesn't fall on the ground and that its top is touching the highest edge of the cage, then add your chair(if necessary)to jump on the painting and sprint towards the other side of the cage.There you should see a machine with a red button, make sure to press it to make it green, and use the items on your left to climb the cage.Then get back to the chair locked door room the same way you got in.Then you should see the exit door with a cage locking it with a lever next to it, press the lever to release the cage(if it doesn't work then the button is still red), and freely open the door.</p>

<p>Another way to reach the machine is  by ignoring the electric lever, and going through all the doors till you reach the cage with the machine behind it.The cage should be opened.When it's opened, go to the machine and press the button.Then get back to the electric box, activate it, and NOW use the hallway to reach the cage and and release it.</p>

<p>Once you open the door, you should see a hallway, in the same time a cutscene will be shown showing the neighbor get in (in a very bad mood). Then the cutscene will end, once it does, you should run the fastest you can through the hallway till you encounter the locked door.Once you do,wait till the neighbor gets you which will activate act two.</p>

<h2>Hello Neighbor act 2</h2>
<p>You're first gonna start at the basement in which you'll see a door, peak through it and wait till you see a wooden statue.Once you see it, open the door and look to your left where you can see a vent, open it and complete your way through it till you see a ladder to your right climb it, open the trapdoor above you, and you should see a the backyard of the house.And you'll notice that the yard is boarded by tall fences.</p>

<p>To escape the yard, there are 3 ways:The crowbar way,the trampoline way, and the red key way.</p>

<p>1.The red key way:</p>

 <p> To aquire the red key you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch. To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of thew switches wasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel. After taking it go back to the platform and back to the pipe, there you should see another pipe, try walking on it till you see a metal rod on it.Place the wheel on the rod, turn the wheel and take it(do the same with the other pipes).Go to the nearest window and break it using the wheel(or any other item) and take it, then enter the the room and open the door.There you should see a machine with another rod, after placing the wheel turn the lever next to it and leave the room.The other pipe is found by climbing a ladder next to and jumping on the roof next it where you should see the pipe(and make sure to take the wheel with you).Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see a hoe, take it and complete your path.Next, you should see a ladder, go down the ladder till you see a roof and another floor, go to the roof and to the ladder.Next, climb down the ladder till you see sand next to the trapdoor, use the hoe on the sand and keep digging till you see a coffin, take the coffin(dont open it)and the dollhouse key should be revealed.Go back to the pool and climb down the ladder to the other floor and there, you should see the dollhouse.Open it, and you should see 2 doors in it.One has a WC next it and another with a machine.Open the one with the machine and go right till you see a door, open it and you should see a huge room with a ladder, stairs, and a door.Go to the door, and you should see the machine(the same one from the dollhouse)with a lever in it.Press the lever and leave the room, then climb the ladder.There you should see a huge hole with a another sink-lookin pipe and another door on the other side.Place the wheel on the pipe and turn.After turning it you should see rising ice.Wait till the ice stops rising and ,then take the opportunity to open the door which should allow you to see another small empty room.Look and right and there you should see the red key.Take it and go back to the huge room, then go down the stairs, ignore the machine infront of you(its for the trampoline waw)and turn left.There you should see a locked door with its key next it.Use the key on the door and you should see the main house door.Go to the door and open it and you shpuld see the red key lock on the fence infront of you.Use the key the on the fence as quickly as possible.Open the fence and run away to activate act 3.</p>

<p>2.The crowbar way:</p>

</p>To aquire the crowbar you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch. To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of the switches wasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel.Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see a hoe, take it and complete your path.Next, you should see a ladder, go down the ladder till you see a roof and another floor, go to the roof and to the ladder.Next, clim down the ladder till you see sand next to the trapdoor, use the hoe on the sand and keep digging till you see a coffin, take the coffin(dont open it)and the dollhouse key should be revealed.Go back to the pool and climb down the ladder to the other floor and there, you should see the dollhouse.Open it, and you should see 2 doors in it.One has a WC next it and another with a machine.Open the one with the WC next to it and go back up the ladder onto the roof.Next go to the house and to the kitchen.You should see two doors in the kitchen open the right one and you should see the toilet with a Lego man on the WC.Take it and go back to the dollhouse, place the Lego man on the WC in the dollhouse and go back again to the toilet.There you should see another gigantic Lego man with a gigantic crowbar.the crowbar can be either used on the windows on the roof or on a wood-boarded hole in the fence.Removing these wood planks is also another way to activate act 3.</p>



<p>To open the trampoline gate you first should go to the front of the house and enter it but be careful the neighbour spends most of his time in this act in his house(I would mostly recommend you to take a box and go to the nearest kitchen window, break the window using the box and make sure the neighbor sees from outside the house, wait till he runs away so you can get inside).If you just entered his house by the door then turn right and you should see a pipe with a switch in the wall,press the switch, go to the kitchen to the fridge, open the top drawer and take the golden wrench.You have switched one out of three pipes.The second is hidden behind a fence and is next to the big pipe with the wheel.To get the third you can either take as many boxes as you can, go to the tallest pipe, and place boxes next to it so you can press the switch.To press it using the second way, you should first use the wrench on the locked door at the backyard next to the trapdoor, climb it, turn right, and you should see the pipe, try walking on it to reach the switch, once you do press it.Then go to the big pipe where the wheel should fall(if it dosent then one of the switcheswasnt pressed), take the wheel and 2 or 3 boxes, then get back to the ladder.Place the boxes on the plant right next to the ladder, then jump on them.Next, you should see the wood and metal infront of you, jump on the metal then wood which should allow you to see the sink-looking pipe.Next, you should place the wheel on it and turn the wheel, which should allow you to see the water leaving the pipe.Wait till the water stops so you can take the wheel.Next you should place the wheel on several pipes, turn it and take it back:first one is next to the tallest pipe.Second one is on top of the roof.Third one is in the room that's next to the tallest pipe that can only be found in the nearest window to the tallest pipe, which is actually a machine not pipe(once you've placed the wheel on the last one you must make sure you've pressed the switch on the machine).Next go back to the backyard and climb the ladder, then open the door next to you.When it does you should see the stairs infront of you, climb it till you see an empty pool.You should then walk on it till you see another room where there are boxes and tables and a ladder, take at least 2 boxes and 1 table and go to the ladder.And walk down the ladder till you see another floor below.Once you land on the floor, you should ignore the locked dollhouse you might see and turn right to see a door, open it and a huge room will be revealed with a ladder, stairs, and door Ignore the door and ladder and walk down the stairs which should allow you to see a machine with another rod.Place your wheel on the machine, turn it(if necessary), press the lever, and turn left to see a locked door with it's key next to it, use the key on the door to open, and you should see another door(it could be open or close)go to the door and open it.Then you should see to your right that the trampoline cage is released, but the electric fence is still there.This is where your your boxes and table come in handy.You should go to the trampoline fence(it's better to keep yourself behind the fence so the neighbor can't see you)place your table then the 2 boxes(this might take alot of tries), jump on them, and this should allow you to jump on the fence and to the trampoline.Once your on the trampoline you're gonna jump very high, take this opportunity to escape the house and activate act 3 as the last way to do it.

<h2>Hello Neighbor 3</h2>
<p>Once you begin act 3, you'll find yourself in an apartment.There you'll have to wait till an eviction notice appears Infront of the door.Oncr you take it, a cutscene will appear showing Nicky pack everything, leave the apartment, and get back to his old house.There you should go to his car's trunk, open it, and you should find a key there.Take it and use in the front door.Then the phone will ring, so you have to pick it up.After picking it up a cutscene will appear showing Nicky watch an old photo of him (as he's 19 times older than he used to be while escaping the neighbor)in a painting.After seeing it he throws his body on the couch and naps.Nicky dreams that his neighbor gets back to hurting his son so he knows that he'll have to finish these memories by saving the kid locked in his neighbor's house.</p>


<h2>Supermarket</h2>
<p>To go to the supermarket in hello neighbor, you're gonna have to enter the neighbor's house,take the chair Infront of the locked door, and throw it anywhere(this is to remove the first part of the locked door).Then to reach the supermarket there are 2 ways:</p>

<p>The ladder way and the in the hole way.</p>

<p>1.The in the hole way.

<p>First enter the neighbour's house.Then go forwards till you reach the locked door.Then go right, then left, then left, till you see some stairs.Climb them, look right, and you should see a giant painting look back and you should see a giant cage with a lantern next to it stuck to the wall.Jump on the lantern, and you should have enough space to jump on the other side of the cage.When you do you'll need to do 2 things, and one of them is optional.The first thing you need to do is go to the wall with paintings and click(not take)on the highest one.Feel free to use boxes or tables to reach the painting.Once you click it, it should move to an opposite direction, make a sound, and the painting on the other side should move down revealing a huge hole.The second thing is pressing a lever which should release the cage, you can also just jump on the lantern and to the other side of the cage.Then go to the hole the painting revealed and climb the stairs you're gonna see and ignore all the doors.Keep climbing them till you see a weird looking door-less pathway.Enter it, keep opening doors, till you see a hole behind a door.Once you find it, jump in it.And you should see another room with an umbrella a bucket, boxes, a lever, a platform, and a door above the platform.Take the umbrella and make sure you have it till you enter the basement, if you want you can take the bucket(for one of the ways to get the key card).Take a box,jump on the platform, and throw the box on the lever.It can take alot of tries to do this trick.Once you've nailed it, the platform should rise.Which should allow you to reach the door.Open it and you should activate the supermarket mini game.</p>

<p>2.The ladder way:</p>

<p>To reach the school minigame in hello neighbor you're first gonna have to take an apple from your stuff or house, then go to the backyard of your neighbor's house, and you should see a hole to your left.The hole will have a lever in it.The lever is closed which makes the door from the other side also closed.So, to press the lever, you'll have 2 ways: First is to just aim at the lever with your apple to open the door.Second is to grab at least 2 boxes and place them next to the hole.So you can jump on the boxes to reach the lever and just press it.Once you press the lever, take a box and throw it at the window next to the hole.Then go left to go through the door and climb the first 2 ladders Infront of you.And make sure to NOT climb the third ladder.Once you climb the second one, you're gonna see a locked rollercoaster railway,but don't walk on it.First walk down the stairs you're gonna see, then open the door on your left.And you're gonna see another locked rollercoaster railway.Once you see it, jump on it, then jump on the platfom with the mannequin.Then break the window Infront of you.And you're in the location.</p>

<p>To complete this minigame, you should move the mini cart Infront and add 5 items in it: a bag of chips, an orange juice, a pickle jar, a pink jar, and a pink bottle(which honestly looks like a bottle of shampoo shower).Once you've got all of them in the cart you should move the cart towards the railway Infront of it(I recommend you to first add one of the items in the cart,move the cart towards the end, then add the other 4 items; sometimes all of the items might fall throughout the journey).There will also be alot of mannequins that'll hunt you when they see you.To know which one sees you, you might sometimes listen to them moving towards you, or you can look at them of they're red.If they're red or make a sound then you should crouch to dodge them.Once you're done avoiding the mannequins and placing the 5 items on your cart and completing the journey, you  can now move to the cashier where there is a machine next to him.The machine has 5 vertical circles that will determine if you can complete your full journey.When the cashier checks a correct item, one of the circles will go green.But, if the cashier checks a wrong item, then one of the circles will go red which will make the platform below disappear, which will make you restart this minigame.But if you get caught by a mannequin, you'll just restart your spot and the cart will still have the items you added.Once all the circles go green, then the cages will be opened and you should be able to run to the exit door without your car, and get the stealth ability.This is btw believed to be the worst minigame in hello neighbor.To exit this place you're gonna have to find another hole near the platform,and find a cage with a lever next to it.Before pressing the lever take something with you and make sure it's not a magnet or a piece of cake.Now press the lever to move the cage and you should see another door.Open it to find a shower tub with a window.Use the item you took to break the window and escape the house.</p>

<h2>School</h2
<p>To reach the school minigame in hello, go to the same place with the train track, then jump on the platform below with a mannequin next to it.Then jump down another hole you're gonna see, and you should see 2 buttons.Press both of them and the train should be unlocked.Once you unlock it, go to the next hole and you should be in the backyard.You should then go back to the train and make sure another item like a box with you must get above it.To get above it there are two ways: first way is by taking an umbrella and walking on the left side of the train till you see one long platform near of it is another platform where you can see windows next to it and a wheel on top of it.Near the wheel.And this platform is the one you should get to.The only way to get to it is by the umbrella, feel free to jump on long platform first(you can press the wheel 3 times from now for one of the ways to get the keycard if you'd like)Next to the platform you should see the END of another station(the train will go through 2 stations,at one the train will stop, and the other the train will keep going.The first one is near the 3 ladders, where the train stops.And the second one has motato plants in it where the train dosent stop). You'll need to wait in the motato plants station where you should wait till the train comes.When it comes, jump on it and wait till the train goes to the roof above the track.Once it does, immediately jump on the roof.Second way is by waiting till the train stops at the station.Once it does, get inside it and get to the control room In this room there will be lever, press it to stop it, and press it again to go back.And press it again to stop once the train is behind the station.And be carefull not to go get it too much close to the station and make sure to get it a bit far way from the metal.Once you feel like everything's ready, jump out of the train and try jumping on the wooden platform next to it with the locked ladder.Then jump on the station, then go to the railway and on to the metal, try to climb it and make sure that you can jump on the train, then jump on the train, then on to the roof you go.Once you've done either way, go left to the ladder from the upper side, and you should see a wrench  take it and keep it for later and make sure not to use it as one of the items you're gonna need later.Then jump on the roof next to the ladder, and you should see motato plants.Try jumping on them or use the gramaphone on them(toturial for the gramaphone is listed in one of my optional links)and walk till you see a trapdoor with a hazard warning.Open it and throw your item on it.And make sure you're not throwing the wrench.Now get back to the first station and find the high hole above the ladder.Try jumping on it, and entering it.And throw away all the boxes in it.Then get in and go to the door on the left side in the room.You should find a magnetic machine in it with a green key next to it.Take the green and make sure TO NOT GO TO THE ROOM BEFORE THROWING YOUR ITEM IN THE HAZARD TRAPDOOR.After taking the key, climb down the 2 ladders and go right, and you should see boxes covering a green locked door next to the ladder.Use the key on the door and enter the school minigame.

<p>2.The school Minigame:</p>

<p>To complete this minigame, you must hide in the first lockers you see, wait till the bell rings, then sprint towards the next locker to avoid the mannequins, and be careful from the white mannequin;it catches even when the bell rings.Once you're in the locker, wait till the start-of-the-class bell rings, and the the end-of-the-class bell rings to go to the next locker.And you can also use table or chair statues as the mannequins can't reach you there.And if you hear a mannequin moving, sprint to the nearest locker or statue.And keep on repeating the same cycle for the other lockers till you reach the last door, and  you should see a mannequin behind it.When you see it, keep on pressing jump/space no matter what.Untill the mannequin falls down.And ignore the other mannequins when you hear their noise;they can't hurt you.Once Nicky goes through the door, the minigame ends and you get the push ability which can be used on your neighbor.If you want to stay in the house then stay.But if you don't then basically unlock the door Infront of you;it has it's key next to it.And you should find yourself in the backyard.</p>

<h2>Giant Room</h2
<p>To go to the giant room minigame, you're gonna have go to the weird looking door-less room above the stairs near the huge painting, go right, take any item from the room, and try to glitch it into the locked lever hole near the cage(if you want to use the glitchless way,then you should check one of my optional links from the top beginning).Once you've glitched it, the lever should work.Then you should go back to the first room(near the hole)and see another locked hole, the same as the one for the lever.In it the red key should be found, and the cage should be unlocked.Take the key and make sure you still have the umbrella with yougo to the ladder near the school minigame locked door.Climb the ladder and go to the beginning of the station, where you should jump on the wooden platform,and go to the locked door and use your wrench on it(If you threw it away then you're gonna have to use the same 2 ways I've mentioned in the school minigame toturial to reach the roof).Then turn right and walk on the diagonal roof you should see, and you should see a small wooden building tied to a rope from the neighbor's house.Open your umbrella and use it to jump in the sky and aim your direction at the building(if you want you can jump then after a few seconds open your umbrella).And make sure the red key is with you.Once you reach the building, you should see a hole in it, fall in the hole, and you should see a red locked door.Use the key on it.And you've just activated the Big room minigame.</p>

<p>3.The Giant room Minigame:</p>

<p>Your gonna start being small.To complete this minigame you're gonna have to play it like a Roblox obby.And if you make any failed jump you might gonna restart the lobby from the beginning. First, go left and walk on a falling platform, then look right and jump on the right platform, then a really high jump will come, it's better to go back, then sprint forward, and jump.Then go right, jump on the can, then the orange juice then the next platform.Then go forward till you see 4 vases, and 3 of them are standing sideways on the platform, while the other one is standing still.Take one of the 3 and throw them strongly at the one standing to break it.Once you do, a platform will fall which you'll have to walk on till you see another one on your left.Jump on it and you should see a thin wooden platform, walk on it and another diagonal one should appear.Walk on that till you see yourself on the door and a stove is next to you, jump on it and it should make you jump very high.Then you'll have to look for a can on the shelf (that looks a little bit outside the shelf) to your right to jump on(if you failed and landed on another platformthen look right and look for two eyes on the left side,if you found the eyes, then follow them to find yourself in another platform walk on it and look left, you should then jump right where you should be on the pizz/clock)then jump on the pizza/clock and jump to the other platforms and becareful;the last ones fall.Then press a lever and jump back to the toaster and you should find yourself in another platform where there are stuff to jump on.Look back and you should see another wooden platform with darts to your left, take 4 and complete your way till you see 3 paper airplanes.Push either the middle one or the third one then jump on it, wait till you see another wooden platform that the plane is heading to.And DON'T wait for the plane just immediately jump.Then continue your way towards the platforms till you see an old phone jump to it's LEFT NOT right and continue till you see a wooden box, use the darts as an lobby to climb the box and complete your way till you see a huge empty space.For this one, sprint towards it and press jump and keep pressing the jump button to complete the minigame and earn your double jump.Then you'll see yourself still in the room but huge now.Then go towards the exit door and you'll be in the building.There should be a ladder there, climb it and you're out of the building.</p>

<h2>Keycard</h2>
<p>To get the keycard in hello neighbor act 3, there are 2 ways:The bucket way and The painting way:</p>

<p>1.The bucket way:</p>

<p>To get the keycard using the bucket way, you should go to the platform where you entered the supermarket and take the bucket from there, if you already did it then enter Nicky's house and enter the bathroom and take another bucket.Then fill them with water using your bathtub or the neighbor's and burn them using your stove or the neighbor's.When 2 of them are are burnt and filled with water, wait so you can be able to touch them then go to the neighbor's and becareful with the spinning below.Once you open the fridge you should see the frozen keycard.Fill it with burned water and if both buckets are empty then again fill them with burned water and use them to melt the ice.And keep on repeating the cycle till the ice is fully melted.And untill you can grab the keycard.</p>

<p>2.The painting way:</p>

<p>To get the keycard using the painting way you're first gonna have to take your umbrella, go to the rollercoaster station near the ladder, climb down the stairs, and open the door on your left.You should see a house Infront of you.First, jump on the train track, then on the house, then look right and you should see a wheel next to the house, go and press the wheel 3 times, and it should break and fly.If you already did it, then make sure it's night if it's not, then kill yourself till it's night, get back to the house, open every door and when you find the moon room, place a chair in the door gramophone next room, take it and throw it near Nicky's house and kill yourself 2 times.Continue your journey in the moon room till you see the sun room, do the same to the door with what you did to the moon room door.And keep opening doors till you see a cage and lever, ignore them and look to your right to see a SpongeBob door open it, and open the next door, and take the guitar that should be in it.Then get back to the cage, use the lever on the cage, crouch, get past it, and continue your journey till you see a flashlight on box right next to a door.Take it and continue your path till you see a room with a huge painting that looks exactly like its opposite side. <img src=https://share.google/images/ZuGTTQEQD2md3m3E0/>
But it's missing some objects.Every single object other than the guitar and flashlight is in the same room.Once everything is done, you should see a wire in the room follow exactly where it goes, and break some windows till you find a cage with a generate in it.If the cage's opened then go to it and click the generator.If it's not then something in the room doesn't look exactly like the painting.Now go to the fridge, wait till the ice melts, and take the keycard</p>

<p>Once you've got the keycard in either 2 ways, use it on the door and make sure that the keycard lock changes colours so you can throw it away.</p>

<h2>Crowbar</h2>
<p>To get the Crowbar in hello neighbour act 3 you should first go to the room where you found the umbrella, but before going to the room, you're first gonna have to look for the electric box within the hole, open it, and you should see a heated crowbar.Dont touch it, it could kill you.Just take it and itll drop.Now go to the other hole in the room and find a magnet in the broken bookshelf, now go back using the lever on the cage.Enter the bathroom and break the window(without using the magnet or cake)and return to the Crowbar.The Crowbar might sometimes cool.If it does then just use it at the door to remove the planks and nails and make sure to remove them off the door's way.But if you haven't, then you'll have 2 ways to cool it.</p>

<p>The bucket way, the Crowbar-to-the-bathtub way(which I named as I haven't had any other name to name it), and the fridge way.</p>

<p>1.The bucket way:</p>

<p>To cool the Crowbar using the Crowbar you're first gonna have to take a bucket with you, go to the bath tub(It could be any bathtub)fill it with water, and pot the water on the Crowbar till it cools to  be able to touch it.</p>

<p>2.Crowbar-to-the-bathtub way:</p>

<p>To get the Crowbar using the Crowbar using the-Crowbar-to-the-Bathtub way, you should first take the magnet, use it on the crowbar, and go to any bathtub.Open the bathtub, and get the crowbar under the water.Once the crowbar turns Gray, that means it cooled.</p>

<p>3.The fridge way:</p>

<p>To cool the crowbar using the fridge way, you should first take the magnet, and use it on the crowbar.Take the magnet to the fridge(it could be any fridge)and release the crowbar in it.Wait at least 11 seconds, and the crowbar should cool by turning Gray.</p>

<p>Once you've cooled the crowbar using each of the 3 ways, take it to the door, and remove the wooden planks.And also make sure that all of the wooden planks and nails are NOT Infront of the door.Otherwise you won't be able to open.Once opened, enter the basement, and get ready to use your abilities.

<h2>Basement</h2>
<p>Once you're in the basement, use the method you used in act 1 to complete your path, but when you're in the bedroom go left, not right.Then right, and keep opening cages using levers and continuing your path till you see a broken refrigerator and hear a weird noise.When you see the fridge stand next to it and immediately crouch, and you should see something walking.If you don't, then you should move a bit further but DON'T pass the fridge then crouch.When you see a monster walking, wait for it to vanish, and for the noise to disappear, then go right, then left.Open the next door then go right and you should see a brick wall to your right.Sprint through it, and here your double jump comes in handy.Continue your way till you see a cage with an opening above it.To jump on it, go back and run forwards then immediately jump 2 times, and you should be above the cage.Then look left, open the exit door.And the Neighbour will find you, and try to catch you Here's where your push ability comes in handy.Keep jumping till he falls back.Now use the exact same method you used in act 1 to pass the hallway, open the door, and you're in act 4/finale.</p>

<p>These are optional and aren't needed but you can do them if you like.</p>

<h2>Gun and get red key using the glitchless way</h2>
<p>To get the gun in hello neighbour act 3, you're gonna need 3 cakes and 4 mannequins placed in the same location where the magnet was placed.</p>

<p>1.Mannequin locations:</p>

<p>The first mannequin is near the hazard box at the train station's roof.It's in the windmill and can be reached only by climbing the ladder in the windmill go left and you have a mannequin.To climb this ladder, you should first go and take the Gramaphone on the motato plants as they border the ladder.The Gramaphone toturial is listed In my links.The second mannequin is near the hole that has the 2 buttons that activate the train.The third mannequin is can be seen using binoculars.To reach you're again gonna need the Gramaphone.Go to the second train track station, and use the Gramaphone on the motato plants, and they should reveal a ladder.Climb down the ladder and the next mannequin is in your eyes.The fourth mannequin is the hardest one to reach;you should first take your binoculars which are found in Nicky's briefcase outside his house, you should then go to the stairs near the huge painting near the red key room location,(Id recommend you to open the door that's 2 floors below if you want the Gramaphone) but it's 1 floor below.There you should see a door with a button near it.Open the door and you shall see a small square wooden platfom standing still.And another very far platform on the other side with a mannequin, a code number, and a cabinet.Use your binoculars to try and read the code.But if you don't want to then the code is:2369.Click the code on the buttons next to you on the wall.The correct patterns look like this:
🔴🟢🟢🔴🔴🟢
🔴🔴🟢🔴🔴🔴.Then the square platform will move back and forth.From your platform side to the mannequin platform side.Once it reaches your side, jump on it(and becareful;the train runs through this location).Once it reaches the mannequin platform side, jump on the platform.And take your mannequin.Do the same thing you did on reaching your current platform.To reach your previous platform.Then go to the room with the magnet, remove the chairs, and add mannequins each Infront of each side of the middle table.</p>

<p>2.The cake pieces:</p>

<p>The first cake is near the supermarket location.Go to the same exact location with the supermarket, then continue your path till you see growing motato plants, ignore them and look right: here's your first piece.You can also get to this location by using the train track with the umbrella, hop on the wheel platform and break a window.And here's your second way.The second cake is in the sun room near the moon room.The third and last piece is a bit harder.You'll need to take an umbrella and a throwing item,walk behind the beginning of the first station of the train track.Look up and right.You should see a window break it with your throwing item and go to the roof with the motato plants using any way.Then go to the far end left to see the metal.The look for the window.Use your umbrella to glide to it.Get to the room and here's your last piece of cake.Place the cake into each plate on the table.And the gift above should fall.If it doesn't then something wasn't placed right.When it does, it'll open and the gun should be revealed.</p>

<p>How to use gun for red key:</p>

<p>To use the gun for the red key for the glitchless use,first take the gun to the hazardous box and throw it at the gears,then get back to the red key room.And go to the machine near the red key cage and press it's lever, and then the gun should drop.Once it does, go to the lever cages room next door, and go to the shelf that has alot of items.Throw all the pick able ones.And go to the other shelf, make sure there aren't any pickable items in the shelves.Then practise aiming your gun at each of them as quickly as possible.Then the cage should open, once it does, press the lever.Then go to the button on the other wall.Press it and immediately get back to the lever cages room.If you're wondering what happened, then let me explain:when you shoot all the items stuck on the shelves as quickly as possible.All will turn the same colour as the bullets.And the cage will open.Once it does,the other huge cage's will work which will l ock you in.So you should press a button on the wall, but, you need to make sure you're not facing it.As pressing it will activate a cage behind you.Which's why you should press while a little bit far from the snall cage's side of the room.Once pressed all the other metal cages will deactivate.And you should repeat the same cycle till you feel like you're ready.Once you are, shoot the 4 items then the other 2 ones.And make sure that you press the last item close to the key's side of the room.Because you need to be fast;the cage will close on you.So once you press the button shoot at the item while aiming at it, quickly run to the other room.And you need to do all this as QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.Then shoot bullets from the gun, and take them and aim them at the lever from behind the metal cage.Once you do, the red key cage will open.Then the red key cage will open.Take it and use it at the big room minigame.</p>

<h2>Gramaphone</h2>
<p>To take the Gramaphone, you'll first need to take the Growing Gramophone.Which's found in the moon room.Then go to the room where you found the piece of cake near the motato plants.Turn on the Gramaphone, wait till the motato plants grow to the size where the tennis ball launchers can't aim at the levers.Then immediately close the Gramaphone or else the game WILL crash.Then make sure that all the levers are facing red.Then go to the room which has the wooden platform that leads to the supermarket minigame.And there should be weird looking room that's has a released cage with three tiny megaphones above and a globe.Take the globe to Nicky's house's fridge.And place the globe in the fridge for 11 seconds.Then take the globe, and immediately run to the neighbour's staircase and open the door below the door with the buttons.Then you should see a weird looking stand.Place the globe on the stand.Once you place the globe in the stand, run as quickly as possible back to the huge painting, to the ladders.And NOW you can climb the third ladder.Make sure there's ice Infront of you If it's water then you were late and need to repeat everything again.Run on the ice, then on the wooden platforms you're gonna see and take the Gramaphone.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>The Gramaphone can be used on the motato plants in the second train station and the motato plants near the windmill.</p

<h2>Hello Neighbour act 4</h2>
<p>Once you're in act 4/finale a.k.a, the Big Neighbour act, you'll be in the same location as the beginning of act 2, and you'll have to wait for the big neighbour(who I'll call Theo for short in this act)to peak at you through the window.Then he'll break the roof.While you should not worry; Theo won't kill you in this act.You will see yourself in an empty white place where there are things that'll help you escape.Theo will have a house in his back, and you need to get to it:First, look for gigantic tables stick together, and jump on them using the double jump ability.Then you should see a control machine that controls the train.Press the button on the machine, and you should see the Theo behind the train.Use your eyes to follow the train till you see a house the train will destroy.Remember this house it will be important later.Then go back to where you started and look for a VERY tall wall with a very lever on it.Aim anything at the lever to activate the toaster behind the wall.Then go behind the wall, and use the stuff you'll see to reach the toaster.Then jump on the toaster and wait till you see a toll cylinder platform and high square platforms.Go to the highest square platform, and you should see a lever Press it and immediately go to the lower platform and look right and jump on the rising platform you're going to see.Then wait for it to stop rising and you should see a vase and window.Break the window using the vase and press the lever then take on the falling umbrellas.If you didn't it's okay;when you die you can still take one of them.Then go back to the toaster and go to the house the train destroyed using the umbrella.And take 2 candles when you land.Then look for fireworks that are Infront of Theo.Then light them with the fireworks.Then get back to the toaster and and look for a shelf with humongous balls.Land on it using your umbrella and push at least 2 into the ball launcher Infront of the balls next to the shelf.Then go to the arrow next to the launcher and fire it with the fireworks.Then get back to the toaster and try to hop on the neighbour's back to reach the house.</p>

<p>The house:</p>
<p>First follow the hallways till you find a glowing door.When you open it, a 9-yr old Nicky will be seen playing while you need to cover him to protect from an incoming house destroyer.Follow the boy out stairs.Then make sure that you're exactly Infront him from a VERY VERY close distance.Once the destruction happens, go down stairs and go behind the stairs, till you see a ladder from far away look right to see weird things.Wait till the boy comes and do the same thing.Then jump on the ladder, look left.Go forwards and crouch wait till Nicky comes.After the second destruction, go left diagonally and keep going down the far hole then climb down the items and Nicky comes.Do the same toll the third destruction.Then climb left to see a staircase and Nicky will come.Do the same but this time after the destruction, a cutscene will.After it stops you'll see the exit door.Open it and you've completed:</p>

        <p>Hello Neighbour</p>

<h2>Speedrun</h2>
<p>Got too much bored completing hello neighbour, well you can just speedrun.Either you're on your tab/phone or laptop, there's a speedrun.</p>

<p>Hello Neighbour speedrun on tab/phone:<p/>

<p>Act 1-possible</p>
<p>Act 2-possible</p>
<p>Act 3-not possible</p>
<p>Act 4/finale-not possible</p>

<p>Hello Neighbour speedrun on laptop:</p>

<p>Act 1-possible</p>
<p>Act 2-possible</p>
<p>Act 3-possible</p>
<p>Act 4/finale-possible</p>



<p>1.Hello Neighbour speedrun act 1:</p>

<p>On tab/phone:To do it, finish the cutscene,take 3 boxes, go to the outdoor staircase, climb it,place 2 boxes,go to the room whith the lever, press it, and go to the left side of the roof.Stand on the left back sharp corner.Aim at the satellite line, then jump, and if you succeeded in standing on the line, JUMP CAREFULLY.If you succeeded on landing on the platform, break the window, and take your red key to the basement door.This could take ALOT of tries, but you can do it.The basement, unfortunately, doesn't have any speedrun.(While some argue that throwing the mannequin on the painting is a normal way.While some say it's just a speedrun.I don't really think it's a speedrun because aiming the mannequin at the painting and making sure the painting doesn't fall is really difficult.And you can easily get lost in the hallways.While in the electric way, just go through the doors).</p>

<p>On laptop:To do it first while chasing the ball, go to a trash can which will probably kill you.And skip the cutscene, then all you need to do is just go to the room where the basement door is.Take the t.v. in the same room, place it Infront of the door.Then just run to the t.v. and you should be in the basement.Then go to the brick wall.Once you've broken it, look for an l-shaped brick, put it Infront of the cage.Then do the same thing you did with the t.v and you should be flying.Press the machine, and SOMETIMES the brick will follow you.If it does, then basically go back using it.But if it doesn't then climb the items on the corner.And after that there's no other speedrun for act 1.</p>

<p>2.Hello Neighbour speedrun act 2:</p>

<p>On tab/phone:after escaping the basement, pressing the 3 switches, unlocking the door.Go to the ladder near the pool
