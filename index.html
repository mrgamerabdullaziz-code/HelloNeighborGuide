<h2>Hello Neighbor Act 1</h2>
<p>To finish Hello Neighbor Act 1,
There are 2 ways to get the red key.</p>
  <p>The wrench and The Lever ways</p>

<p>1.The wrench way:</p>

<p>First you'll need to take at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see alot of paintings in the room(you might also see a lever on top of the ladder do not press it).Take the biggest one.A hole will later be revealed.Go through the hole(jumping will help).Then take your left, you should see 3 keys, take the left, red one, which is the car key.Then go back through the hole again, go out through the window, then jump outside towards the neighbors car. Open the cars front.There you should see a magnet, take the magnet to the back of the house, there you should also see tons of boxes, take at least 2 or 3. Then find the small hole next to the locked ladder. There you should place your boxes and jump on them(if you are too much above the hole you can take a box). Look for the shelf in which you can see many items. You'll only need the lockpick. Take it by pushing and holding the magnet.When you have the lockpick, throw away anything else then look for an open window in the backyard and keep on going left until you find the locked door.Then you should use the lockpick to open the door and take the goldet wrench, then you should get back using the same way you got in(and you should do this as fast as you can). You should later use the wrench on the locked ladder and climb it.Once you're done climbing, you should see a plank, walk on it and jump on the broken roof roof Infront of you.Then you should see the red key.</p><br/><br/>

<p>2.The lever way: </p>

First you'll need to take  the ball and at least 2 boxes(if you want you can take 3 or 4 in case)then go to the neighbors house and climb the outdoor ladder.Then place a box or 2 Infront of you and jump on top of them.Then you'll have to jump on the roof with the windows.Then use the other left boxes you have to break the window.Then you should see a wooden board with a lever to your right,take the biggest painting and go through the hole.Once you're there keep going forwards till you see a lever,press it then go back to the plank.There you should also see a fan with a small switch in it.Press the switch, place your ball and go back as fast as you can to the left side of the house, Infront of the car(and make sure a box or trash can is with you.)There you should see a platform in which there's a window above it,sprint towards the window and wait till the platform rises.Once it does break the window then get inside the room.Then you should see the red key.</p>
<p>Once you see the key in either way go back outside the house, go inside and go right there you should see the red door lock.Open the lock then get in the basement.</p>

<p>The basement</p>

<p>Once you're in the basement, walk down the stairs, and open the washer machine.Then a secret passage should be revealed.Walk through it and you should see a sleeping room.There you'll see four windows, go towards the right ones and take one.Sprint your way towards every caged door you see while also ignoring every wooden door(if you're late the neighbor will come for you)and then you should see a mannequin, take it and keep sprinting.Once you see two side hallways left and right take the right one and keep running.There you should see another caged door and another mannequin and a lever.Unlock the door using the lever and if you didn't take the first mannequin, feel free to take this one, but if you did ignore this one.Once you enter the room, you can open the chair locked door this time by taking the chair(and keeping it with you) and opening the door.Then you should see a brick wall, run towards it breaking it.Then you should see a humongous cage to your right, this is where you get to use your items.Place the painting Infront of the cage(facing it's opposite side),throw your mannequin at the top of the painting in a very strong way,make sure it doesn't fall on the ground and that its top is touching the highest edge of the cage, then add your chair(if necessary)to jump on the painting and sprint towards the other side of the cage.There you should see a machine with a red button, make sure to press it to make it green, and use the items on your left to climb the cage.Then get back to the chair locked door room the same way you got in, then you should see the exit door with a cage locking it with a lever next to it, press the lever to release the cage(if it doesn't work then the button is still red), and freely open the door.Once you open the door, you should see a hallway, in the same time a cutscene will be shown showing the neighbor get in (in a very bad mood). Then the cutscene will end, once it does, you should run the fastest you can through the hallway till you encounter the locked door.Once you do,wait till the neighbor gets you which will activate act two.</p>
<h2 id="2">Hello Neighbor 2</h2>
<p>You're first gonna start at the basement in which you'll see a door, peak through it and wait till you see a wooden statue.Once you see it, open the door and look to your left where you can see a vent, open and complete your through it till you see a ladder to your right climb it, open the trapdoor above you, and you should see a the backyard of the house.And you'll notice that the yard is boarded by tall fences.</p>

</p>To escape the yard, there are 3 ways:The crowbar way,the trampoline way, and the red key way.</p>

<p>The red key way:</p>
